A dashboard for git statistics

We will show the most active contributors across all your projects as well as the
activity in all your projects and repositories in a single location.

To install:
1. Create a python venv and activate it
2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install node
4. run `npm install`
5. to compile the javascripts do `npm run build`. During active development use `npm run watch` instead
6. run the analyze management command by pointing to the top level folder in your hard disk where the projects are stored
7. start the django development server with `manage.py runserver` (or use daphne)
8. point your browser to http://localhost:8000
